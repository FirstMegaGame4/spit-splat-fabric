# You will find him floating above the oceans (except frozen and all deep oceans), he is aggressive when he sees a player but does not attack in close combat. Instead, he'll spit a bubble at you.

# This bubble will give you a new potion effect, the bubble trap. You will not take damage but will be stuck in a bubble, slowly floating upwards before popping as you fall.

# Spit Splat is tamable with some kelp (if you can approach him quickly enough !) and will become in turret mode when you right-click on him, defending the area and floating without moving.

# By killing a few Spit Splats, you will obtain a raw Spit Splat but also scales.

# The raw Spit Splat gives you the bubble effect for 2 seconds, allowing you to use it in climbing situations, to return to the surface of an ocean or to craft potions.

# While the cooked Spit Splat gives you the bubble effect, but also the slow falling effect when the bubble pop. Allowing you to reach the ground without taking any damage.
